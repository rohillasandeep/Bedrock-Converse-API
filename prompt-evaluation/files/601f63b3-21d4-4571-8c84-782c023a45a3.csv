"Cyber Saviors","What are the pros/cons and use cases of using EventBridge, Lambda with queues, and SNS for event-driven architectures? My customer wants to fully understand when to use EventBridge, Lambda, and SNS for event-driven architectures. I consider this question to be solved when I have a use case, a pro and con for each of these technologies.For instance, Amazon SNS is recommended for high throughput or low latency messages published by other applications or microservices. https://event-driven-architecture.workshop.aws/4-sns.html Thanks!","{""message"": ""Amazon EventBridge:\nUse case: EventBridge is a serverless event bus that allows you to connect your applications with data from AWS services, SaaS applications, and your own applications. It is well-suited for building event-driven architectures where you need to process events from multiple sources and route them to different targets.\nPro: EventBridge provides a centralized event bus that can simplify the integration between different components of your application, making it easier to build scalable and loosely coupled systems.\nCon: EventBridge may add additional complexity to your architecture, as you need to set up rules and targets to handle the events. This can increase the overall management and maintenance overhead of your system. AWS Lambda with Queues:\nUse case: Using AWS Lambda with queues, such as Amazon SQS, is recommended when you need to process events asynchronously and handle high-volume or bursty workloads. This approach can help decouple the event producer from the event consumer, allowing for more scalable and resilient event processing.\nPro: Queues can help smooth out the load on your Lambda functions, allowing them to process events at a steady pace and avoid being overwhelmed by sudden spikes in event volume.\nCon: Introducing a queue can add latency to your event processing, as events need to be stored in the queue before being processed by the Lambda function. This may not be suitable for use cases that require near real-time processing. Amazon SNS:\nUse case: Amazon SNS is recommended for high-throughput or low-latency message delivery, particularly when you need to publish messages to multiple subscribers. It is well-suited for use cases where you need to notify multiple systems or applications about events.\nPro: SNS provides a simple and scalable way to publish messages to multiple subscribers, making it a good choice for building fan-out architectures.\nCon: SNS may not be the best choice for use cases that require complex event processing or transformation, as it is primarily focused on message delivery and not on event processing logic.""}","https://d3i0bz2g1d4y1i.cloudfront.net//api/","Guide-01","6.828184","200"

"Cyber Saviors","What are SageMaker hosting benefits compared to self managed hosting? For customers already running a self managed platform for microservices (say ECS/EKS) - What are the benefits of using SageMaker Hosting (endpoints)?","{""message"": ""The key benefits of using Amazon SageMaker hosting services compared to self-managed hosting include:\n\n1. Fully managed hosting: SageMaker handles the provisioning, scaling, and management of the underlying infrastructure, allowing you to focus on your machine learning models rather than managing the hosting environment. 2. Automatic scaling: SageMaker can automatically scale the compute resources up or down based on demand, ensuring your models can handle fluctuations in traffic without manual intervention. 3. High availability: SageMaker deploys your models across multiple Availability Zones, providing high availability and fault tolerance for your production endpoints. For customers already running a self-managed platform like ECS or EKS, the key benefits of using SageMaker hosting include:\n\n1. Reduced operational overhead: SageMaker handles the provisioning, scaling, and management of the hosting infrastructure, allowing you to focus on your machine learning models rather than managing the hosting environment. 2. Easier model deployment: SageMaker provides a streamlined process for deploying models to production, with a simple API to create and manage hosting endpoints. 3.

"Cyber Saviors","What factors should we consider when deciding Dynamo DB DAX Vs ElastiCache? Context:Partner currently using DynamoDB. Two types of look ups (one that is relatively fixed; the other type is quite dynamic – i.e. a write of a new record followed by subsequent lookups).Just looking for general guidance / considerations. Thanks!","{""message"": ""When deciding between DynamoDB DAX and ElastiCache, there are a few key factors to consider: 1. Data access patterns: For the relatively fixed lookups, DynamoDB DAX may be a good option as it provides low-latency caching of DynamoDB data. However, for the more dynamic lookups where new records are frequently written, ElastiCache may be a better choice as it provides a more flexible in-memory data store that can handle frequent updates. 2. Consistency requirements: DynamoDB DAX provides strongly consistent reads, while ElastiCache can offer different consistency models (e.g. eventual consistency) which may be more suitable for your use case. 3. Operational complexity: DynamoDB DAX is tightly integrated with DynamoDB and can be easier to manage, while ElastiCache requires more setup and maintenance as a separate data store. 4. Cost: The pricing models for DynamoDB DAX and ElastiCache differ, so you'll need to evaluate the costs based on your specific usage patterns and requirements.""}","https://d3i0bz2g1d4y1i.cloudfront.net//api/","Guide-05","5.316707","200"
